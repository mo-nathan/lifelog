# lifelog
Tools for recording life events

To see what events exist:
- Ensure that sqlite3 is installed.
- Access schema.db with `sqlite3 schema.db` for a blank db
- Other dbs are stored with the .lifelog suffix.
- List tables in sqlite3 with `.tables`.
- Describe a table with `.schema <table-name>` (no trailing ';')
